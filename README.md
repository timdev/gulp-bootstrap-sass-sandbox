# What's this?

Not much to see here.  It's just a personal sandbox to play with not-ancient front-end tech/tooling,
starting with gulp.

## Setting up

After cloning this repo for the first time, you'll want to pull in all the dependencies:

* `npm install` -- Installs necessary npm packages for development into node_modules/
* `gulp bower` -- Installs bootstrap-sass, and friends, in bower_components/

Basically, just do `grunt watch` and play with sass files in resources/sass.

##

Next steps:

- [ ] Get bs3's javascript into the build system and loaded on a page.
- [ ] Make generated artifacts nice and minified.
- [ ] Think about playing with some web-components stuff.  That could be fun.
